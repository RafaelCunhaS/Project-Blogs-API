## Blogs API

Back-end project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

In this project I developed a RESTful API and a database (_MySQL_) for producing content for a blog. I developed the app with _Node.js_ using the __Sequelize__ package to make a _CRUD_ (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of posts, also working with relationships and associations of the tables. With a bonus of 100% test coverage with integration tests.

### How to run the project

```bash

    # Clone the repository
    $ git clone git@github.com:RafaelCunhaS/Project-Blogs-API.git

    # Go into the project's directory
    $ cd Project-Blogs-API

    # Install the dependencies
    $ npm install
